      <description>The research group works on the statistical theory of machine learning and artificial intelligence, We provide mathematical understanding of learning algorithms, thereby establishing black-box AI tools as formal statistical principles. Our research focuses on three aspects of data science in the present era of big data analysis.
 Data complexity: Many applications involve complex data, such as relational information, texts etc., that often lack natural Euclidean structure. Hence, learning from such data require non-parametric approaches or representation learning.</description>

      <description>Open positions Full-time PhD student We are looking for a PhD student, who is eager to work on the theoretical aspects of machine learning. The research would be related to one of the following topics:
 Theory of deep learning (potentially Graph Neural Networks)
 Communities and hierarchies in large random networks
 Hypothesis testing and inference for high-dimensional data
  The position is a full time position on the German pay scale E13 (100%).</description>
