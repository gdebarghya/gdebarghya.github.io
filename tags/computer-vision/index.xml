      <description>The project focussed on the problem of clustering complex networks that can be modelled as hypergraphs. Clustering hypergraphs has a long history, and a wide range of applications including motion segmentation, categorical data clustering and VLSI circuit partitioning. However, the theory of this problem was not well studied. My works are among the first studies on consistency of practical hypergraph clustering algorithms under a random planted community model. Along with proving theoretical guarantees, we also proposed efficient algorithms that achieve states-of-the-art results in motion segmentation and subspace clusterin</description>
